When your welcome pack says "all essentials available", they aren't kidding!... Clean, well equipped and well maintained, and spacious. The location to all things Killington is prefect from proximity to slopes to nightlife/restaurants." ~ Emily P.</figcaption>

You won't be disappointed!My family and I chose this condo after emailing and chatting with the owner Jules. It was such a great experience staying there! There were many personal touches that you wouldn't find in most rental units... It is super convenient to the ski slopes with free shuttles departing regularly! The owner was a pleasure to work with - wish all rentals were this exceptional!â€‹ ~ Connie W.</a>.</figcaption>

My husband and I just came back from a beautiful 5 nights staying in this condo during fall foliage season in Vermont. It happened to be our 22nd anniversary and I always wanted to get up there for the leaves changing. The condo was located in a perfect setting surrounded by the mountains and right across the street from the ski slopes." ~ Lynn F.</a>.</figcaption>

									<img src="img/mountain/view2.jpg" width="100%" /><figcaption>"My family of 4 stayed in this condo during our late spring break in April. Jules was so gracious and helpful in the planning and very easy to work with. The condo itself was comfortable and cozy - having a 2nd bathroom was a major plus. Kids loved having their own room with super comfortable beds. My younger one made good use of the pool & hot tub, we used the fireplace one night, and we had the building and parking lot almost to ourselves" ~ Amy M.</figcaption>
